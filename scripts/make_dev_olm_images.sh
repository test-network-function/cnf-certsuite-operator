# Developer's script to build all the operator's container images and push them to a custom quay account.
# Only VERSION (e.g. 0.0.4) and REPO (e.g. quay.io/myaccount/myop) env vars are needed.
# These images will be built and pushed to the appropriate registry:
# - sidecar app
# - controller
# - bundle
# - catalog
#
# These env vars should be exported to be used by this script:
# - VERSION: "without the v". E.g: "0.2.1", "1.0.1"
# - REPO: the docker registry repo for the operator, e.g: "quay.io/myaccount/my-operator"
#
# Only one image registry is needed as all the images will share the same name. The corresponding suffix will be
# appended to the version to distinguish them. For example, running this command:
#  VERSION=0.0.2 REPO=quay.io/myaccount/myop ./make_dev_olm_images.sh
# will make and upload these images:
#   quay.io/myaccount/myop:v0.0.1-controller
#   quay.io/myaccount/myop:v0.0.1-sidecar
#   quay.io/myaccount/myop:v0.0.1-bundle
#   quay.io/myaccount/myop:v0.0.1-catalog
#
# At the end of the script, the command to install this developer operator version will be shown, like:
#   OLM_INSTALL_IMG_CATALOG=quay.io/myaccount/myop:v0.0.1 make olm-install

# Fast exit on any returned error.
set -o errexit

# Check both VERSION and REPO env vars exist and are not empty.
