# Builds the operator's controller and sidecar images. The manager's env var
# with the sidecar app image is also replaced with the new name, which is set
# using the value from env var SIDECAR_IMG. It will be defaulted to DEFAULT_SIDECAR_IMG

#
# This script is intended to be used in CI workflows to create loca/test images just for
# testing purposes, but can also be used to generate images for new official releases. In
# that case, the following env vars should have been exported before running this script:
#   VERSION : The desired new/test version tag that will be applied to both images.
#   IMG     : The image for the controller's container.
#

# Bash settings: display (expanded) commands and fast exit on first error.
